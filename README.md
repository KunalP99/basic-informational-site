# Basic Informational Site
A very basic site that uses NodeJS.

During this project, I learnt about:
- The HTTP module which I used to create my server and display the content
- The File System module to read from and write to files
- The Path module to access file paths and to find the correct paths to dislay them on screen
- Status codes
- Route switching 
- nodemon (server will update automatically every time code is saved)
- Handling errors when a page is not found or when the server is not working as expected
- Content-Types and why they are important
